Welcome to the Python binding of the Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS) algorithm! 

Documentation for this package is hosted at: https://pycorels.readthedocs.io/

For information on CORELS, please visit our website: https://corels.eecs.harvard.edu.

For the code of this package, visit: https://github.com/fingoldin/pycorels

CORELS uses Python, Numpy, GMP, and a C++ compiler (g++ is a great choice).
GMP (GNU Multiple Precision library) is not required, but it is *highly recommended*, as it improves performance. If it is not installed, CORELS will run slower.
